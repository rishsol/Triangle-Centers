# Triangle-Centers
Provides a visual of the various triangle centers (centroid, incenter, circumcenter, and orthocenter) by displaying the intersection of the three appropriate line segments for each center (line bisectors, angle bisectors, etc.). 

The program specifically involves determining a specific triangle center of a randomly generated triangle (one triangle is randomly generated upon each compilation)
