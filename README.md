Triangle-Centers

The program provides a visual of a specific triangle center of a randomly generated triangle (one triangle is randomly generated upon each compilation of the program) by depicting the intersection of the three appropriate line segments for each center (line bisectors, angle bisectors, etc.)

The program involves a RandomTriangle superclass which generates a triangle or random side lengths. Each subclass depicts the same triangle with the specified triangle center (as the intersection of 3 appropriate line segments).
